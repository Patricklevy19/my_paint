# my_paint

The my_paint is a project realized in C language with the SFML graphic library. It consists in reproducing the software "paint" that we find on our various computers. It has been realized by groups of two in three weeks.  
To try it you have to type in your terminal 
## "git clone git@github.com:Patricklevyy/my_paint.git".
Then enter the folder and type the command 
## "make re" 
to compile it and finally
## "./my_paint" 
to run it.

Once the window is open you must click on the button to draw then you must choose a color among those available. You can also use the eraser to erase what you think you drew wrong. Finally when you have finished your drawing you can click on the button to save it in .jpeg, .jpg, .png or .bmp format.
